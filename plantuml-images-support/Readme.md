# Support to Render PlantUML Diagrams in the Author Visual Editing Mode

This plugin allows the Author visual editing mode to render PlantUML diagrams embedded in DITA topics.

To install:
 1. Download a zip of the entire **wsaccess-javascript-sample-plugins** parent project (https://github.com/oxygenxml/wsaccess-javascript-sample-plugins/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), 
 1. Copy the folder **plantuml-images-support** to the Oxygen **plugins** folder 
 1. Restart Oxygen. 
 1. You can later open the **testDiagram.dita** sample topic in the Oxygen editing area to see if the diagrams are properly rendered in the Author visual editing mode.

There is a text area under the image in which you can edit the textual description, in addition double clicking the diagram image will show a dialog box that contains the original diagram text content that can be edited.
